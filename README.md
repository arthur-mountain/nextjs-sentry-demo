# The frontend monitoring demo
  Build the frontend monitoring with NextJs and Sentry

NextJs:
  Next13 and app route

Sentry:
  Create `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` with the default Sentry.init.
  Create `sentry.properties` with configuration for sentry-cli (which is used when automatically uploading source maps).
